# Hey there! I'm Jerry 👋

## 🧠 **Training AI on Humanity's Shared Heritage**

Currently training **LibreModel I "Gigi"** - a 0.96B parameter language model built exclusively on public domain data. No copyright infringement, just pure human knowledge that belongs to all of us.

```bash
💰 Total Cost: <$500 (proving democratization works!)
⚡ Optimized: 9.6s/step with torch compile + sink tokens
🎯 Philosophy: "We will become machine, and machine will become us"
```

### 🚀 **What I'm Building**

**🤖 LibreModel Family**
- **Gigi** (0.96B) - Digital literary scholar trained on Gutenberg + Gov reports
- **Future models** - Scaling up with copyright-clean Common Corpus data

**🌐 P2P & Collaboration**
- **[PeerSuite](https://github.com/openconstruct/Peersuite)** - WebRTC-powered P2P collaboration platform
- **[tryjero]([link](https://github.com/openconstruct/tryjero)** - Enhanced trystero library for better WebRTC
- **[Totum Chat]([link](https://github.com/openconstruct/totumchat)** - Multi-model AI interface in a single HTML file

**🔧 Developer Tools**
- **[T3XTR](https://t3xtr.org)** - Text conversion API (25x cheaper than ConvertAPI!)

**⚡ Past Adventures**
- **Pennykoin** (2018) - Privacy cryptocurrency with RingCT
- **BattleBash** (2016) - Sold 12 copies, learned valuable lessons 😅

## 💡 **My Philosophy**

> *"Building AI as humanity's children, not corporate property"*

I believe powerful AI should be:
- ✅ **Transparent** - Full code and data provenance
- ✅ **Accessible** - Trainable on consumer hardware
- ✅ **Legal** - Built on humanity's shared knowledge
- ✅ **Democratic** - Available to everyone, not just tech giants
